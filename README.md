### DON'T DOWNLOAD THE MACRO FROM THE MAIN PAGE. FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION SECTION PLEASE ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
 This version of Sol's RNG macro includes many community request features. A work in progress - noteab

## Installation
  - First of all, you need to download **[AutoHotKey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)** (Not 2.0), and run the installer
  - Once complete, download the most recent version of NoteaM through the most recent [GitHub Release](https://github.com/noteab/dolphSol-Improvement-Macro/releases/latest) (Download source code ZIP)
  - After downloading, extract the ZIP file to your desired directory
  - You can now run dolphSol through the Main.ahk file in the folder

## Running the Macro
  - You can run the PYTHON macro by opening "macro.bat".
  - You can run the AUTOHOTKEY macro by opening "Main.ahk".

## Features
Noteab's Macro has a couple of different features it is capable of. These include:
 - Automatic Obby Completion, with an option to check if it is completed in case it has to be redone
 - Automatic Item Collection, with options to set which spots to collect from if sharing a server
 - Automatic Aura Equipping, so you can always have an aura equipped without an animation to ensure the macro performs well
 - Discord Webhook support
 - Reconnecting upon disconnect
 - Setting for the VIP gamepass to compensate for the increased WalkSpeed
 - Settings importing, useful for updates
### This Improvement Macro also includes
 - Automatic Merchant Crafting
 - Discord remote bot commands
 - Aura Recordings

## FAQ (Will add more questions soon)
-- Congratulate to everyone who patiently complete my installation & instruction guide, so this is how you use the command correctly --

(1) If you open the discord_cmd.py but the slash command in your discord wont show up? What should you do? --> Use "/sync" command and refresh the discord page, it should be update all the existing command list for you. Or uncomment await bot.tree.sync() in async def on_ready() and refresh your discord browser then comment that bot.tree.sync() (prevent from being ratelimited)

(2) For the reconnection, I have reverted back to deeplink method, auto detection sol rng server shutdown message and roblox disconnect popup, after reconnect it will reset the camera angle to let the AHK macro do its job properly.

(?) Soon...
